# Anime-Recommendations-Rystem
## Introduction:
Nowadays, Anime is becoming more popular as more people start watching them and talking about them on social media. However, some believe that anime is only about attack on titan, one piece, and Neverland.
Consequently, they miss out on a lot of great anime by limit their attention to currently popular shows.
Therefore, the idea of my project started.
## Objectives:
Helps the user find upcoming and older anime that doesn't receive a lot of attention based on:
- The genre the user prefers.
- The Anime the user has previously watched based on its genre.
